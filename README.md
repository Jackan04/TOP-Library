A simple library application that allows users to manage their book collection. Users can add new books, mark books as read or unread, and delete books from the library. The application uses local storage to persist data across sessions.

## Features

- Add new books with a title, author, and publication year.
- Mark books as "Read" or "Not Read."
- Delete books from the library.
- Data is saved in the browser's local storage, so it persists across page reloads.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure of the application.
- **CSS**: For styling the application, including a responsive layout.
- **JavaScript**: For dynamic functionality, including adding, deleting, and toggling book statuses.
- **Local Storage**: For saving the library data persistently in the browser.

   - Click the "New Book" button to open the modal.

   - Click "Add Book" to save the book to the library.

2. **Mark as Read/Unread**:
   - Click the "Read" or "Not Read" button in the "Status" column to toggle the book's read status.
